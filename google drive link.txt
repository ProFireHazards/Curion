Descriptions:

V3 was a bridge between V2 and V4 a near-complete re-write, a hybrid of sorts, turned into V4.

V2 was the ORIGINAL HUD. It was made of spaghetti code and got too hard to keep up with.

V1 was a bit of a test. An eyeball that followed you with music and a stylized display. This was the original vision, not you seeing the world but rather a Curious AI (HA! The name!) watching you. Spaghetti code so bad I need to rebuild it to get it to work. It was meant to learn dynamically based on what it saw and researched, was created about a month or so before LLMs blew up.

Vista and Base were attempts at making a "DIY modular" version of the HUD and assistant. It did not work.

The "Assistant" branch is a bit of what Vista and Base tried to be, made stuff modular and made V3 become V4.

The experimental assistant branch I think was the test for adding Yolo V5 rather than V3, and I am fairly sure I didn't finish and it got abandoned and broken, I kinda just implimented it without testing and this branch wasn't really needed.

V4 Is the current in-development version, it's near complete, it needs a splashscreen, clock, subtitles, translation, auto-lobotomizer (IMPORTANT), and possibly a log mode (like V2).
